{-
The number portion of an interval (i.e. second, third, etc).

Note that the interval number is always one step larger than number of steps spanned by
the interval (i.e. a third spans two diatonic steps). Thus 'number' does not distribute
over addition:

> number (a + b) = number a + number b - 1
-}

{-
Common pitch representation.

Intervals and pitches can be added using '.+^'. To get the interval between
two pitches, use '.-.'.

Pitches are normally entered using the following literals.

> c d e f g a b

Notes with accidentals can be written by adding the @s@ or @b@ suffices
(or two for double sharps and flats).

> cs, ds, es ...    -- sharp
> cb, db, eb ...    -- flat
> css, dss, ess ... -- double sharp
> cbb, dbb, ebb ... -- double flat

There is also a convenience syntax for entering pitches one octave up or
down, using @'@ and @_@ respectively.

> g a b c'
> d c b_ c

Because of some overloading magic, we can actually write @sharp@ and
@flat@ as /postfix/ functions. This gives a better read:

> cs == c sharp
> db == c flat

You can of course use typical functional transformation of pitch as well.
For example 'sharpen' and 'flatten' are the ordinary (prefix) versions of
'sharp' and 'flat'

> sharpen c             == c sharp       == cs
> flatten d             == d flat        == ds
> (sharpen . sharpen) c == c doubleSharp == css
> (flatten . flatten) d == d doubleFlat  == dss

Note that there is no guarantee that your pitch representation use
enharmonic equivalence, so @cs == db@ may or may not hold.

> c .+^ minor third == eb
> f .-. c           == perfect fourth

Pitches are described by name, accidental and octave number.

> c   == fromIntegral 0
> _P4 == perfect fourth   == interval Perfect 5
> d5  == diminished fifth == diminish (perfect fifth)

-}

{-
A musical interval such as minor third, augmented fifth, duodecim etc.

We include direction in in this definition, so a downward minor third (written @-m3@)
is distinct from an upward minor third (written @m3@). Note that @_P1@ and @-P1@ are
synynoms.

Not to be confused with a mathematical inverval in pitch space, which is called
'Ambitus'. Intervals and pitches form an affine-vector space pair with intervals and
/vectors/ and pitches as /points/. To add an interval to a, use '.+^'. To get the
interval between two pitches, use '.-.'.

> c .+^ minor third == eb
> f .-. c           == perfect fourth

Adding intervals preserves spelling. For example:

> m3 ^+^ _M3 = _P5
> d5 ^+^ _M6 = m10

The scalar type of 'Interval' is 'Int', using '^*' to stack intervals of a certain type
on top of each other. For example @_P5 ^* 2@ is a stack of 2 perfect fifths, or a major
ninth. The 'Num' instance works as expected for '+', 'negate' and 'abs', and
(arbitrarily) uses minor seconds for multiplication. If you find yourself '*', or
'signum' on intervals, consider switching to '*^' or 'normalized'.

Intervals are generally described in terms of 'Quality' and 'Number'. To construct an
interval, use the 'interval' constructor, the utility constructors 'major', 'minor',
'augmented' and 'diminished', or the interval literals:

> m5  == minor   fifth    == interval Minor   5 > _P4 == perfect fourth   == interval
Perfect 5 > d5  == diminished fifth == diminish (perfect fifth)

-}


{-
An accidental is either flat, natural or sharp.

This representation allows for an arbitrary number of flats or sharps rather than just
single and double.

The 'Num' and 'Enum' instances treat 'Accidental' as the number of altered semitones,
i.e. a double flat is @-2@, natural @0@ and so on.

-}

{-
Interval quality is either perfect, major, minor, augmented, and
diminished. This representation allows for an arbitrary number of
augmentations or diminutions, so /augmented/ is represented by @Augmented
1@, /doubly augmented/ by @Augmented 2@ and so on.

The quality of a compound interval is the quality of the simple interval on
which it is based.

-}

{-
An interval represented as a number of octaves, including negative
intervals.

> octaves a = semitones a `div` 12
> steps   a = semitones a `mod` 12
